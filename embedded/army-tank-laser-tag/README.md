# Army Tank Laser Tag
This was another project for Maker Faire Detroit. This was for 2016.

Originally this was going to be a portable table with the tanks driving around on it.

Later it had to be left in an incomplete state since we needed the last joysticks for the main table when they decided to add more robots to that.

So in the end, both robots had to share a joystick and therefore drive identically.

The next change would have been to add the extra joystick and get both robots working independently.

This was mainly written by students and I managed the projects.
