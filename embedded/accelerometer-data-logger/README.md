# G Meter Mobile - 2011
I wanted to test different racing tires on different clay surfaces for my racing remote control truck.

So I soldered a small system on a prototype board using a Parallax Propeller, accelerometer, and sd reader/writer.

This was a very quick project, maybe a couple days, on Christmas Break of 2010-2011.
