# Resume
A place for me to show some stuff I made and other projects I managed.

## Computer Vision
[Computer Vision Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv)

### SLAM - 2022
In the process of making Anki Cozmo do SLAM through a Lego city.

### MNIST From Scratch - 2022
Made MNIST from scratch using Numpy.

In addition, I made a version where I can take pictures with Anki Cozmo and have it predict the new hand written numbers.

Also, I am making MNIST from scratch with C++.

### Maze Solving Robot - 2015
[![Youtube Link][logo]](https://youtu.be/stuCPNpmuDA) &nbsp; [Maze Solving Robot](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/maze-solving-robot)
This was a robot commanded by a Raspberry Pi that would take a picture of a maze before navigation.

### Robotics Competition Win - 2013
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjJAI83jM0
This robot was in a simulated shipping port. The goal was to pick up blocks, and place them in the correct place based on their size and color. I was in charge of the Computer Vision.

### Other Small Programs
There are several other small things, such as making a Sobel Operator with Numpy for example. This would be found in the Spatial folder.

## Embedded
Non Computer Vision projects, that are embedded.

### Army Tank Laser Tag - 2017
https://youtu.be/EbC444fI4sk?t=244
Students made this project and I oversaw it. There were a couple versions. I think the one I uploaded here was for the portable cart. There was another on a big table shared by the Construction Robots

### Construction Robots - 2017
https://youtu.be/EbC444fI4sk?t=244
Another project I oversaw which was made by students. A dump truck, loader, and bulldozer would scoop beads.

### Logitech Driver Using Assembly - Christmas Break 2010-2011
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJqs5wlxxEY
I reverse engineered how the joystick worked, and replaced the board so it would work with microcontrollers.

## Simulations
I've written simulation algorithms over the years. This is where I'll add old ones I find or new ones I write.

### Brake Rotor Heat Transfer - 2012
Simulating temperatures in brake rotors.
