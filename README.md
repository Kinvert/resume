# Resume
A place for me to show some stuff I made and other projects I managed.

## Computer Vision
Under the cv folder are some things I've done in Computer Vision.

### SLAM - 2022
In the process of making Anki Cozmo do SLAM through a Lego city.

### MNIST With Numpy - 2022
Made MNIST from scratch using Numpy.

In addition, I made a version where I can take pictures with Anki Cozmo and have it predict the new hand written numbers.

### Maze Solving Robot - 2015
This was a robot commanded by a Raspberry Pi that would take a picture of a maze before navigation.

### Other Small Programs
There are several other small things, such as making a Sobel Operator with Numpy for example. This would be found in the Spatial folder.

## Embedded
Non Computer Vision projects, that are embedded.

Students made this project and I oversaw it. There were a couple versions. I think the one I uploaded here was for the portable cart. There was another on a big table shared by the Construction Robots

### Construction Robots - 2017

Another project I oversaw which was made by students. A dump truck, loader, and bulldozer would scoop beads.

### Logitech Driver Using Assembly - Christmas Break 2010-2011
I reverse engineered how the joystick worked, and replaced the board so it would work with microcontrollers.
