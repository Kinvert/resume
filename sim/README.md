# Simulations
I've written simulation algorithms over the years.

I'll add some in as I find old ones, or write new ones.

## Brake Rotor Heat Transfer - Matlab 2012
A simulation for heat transfer in brake rotors I wrote in Matlab in 2012.

When I struggle with abstract topics I tend to make a real world project that will require that topic. This was one of those instances.
