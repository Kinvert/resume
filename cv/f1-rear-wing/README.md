# F1 Rear Wing - 2011
An F1 technical writer sent me this to see what I could find out.

I used Matlab to isolate the wing profile, and get points I could then import in to XFOIL.

XFOIL can run simulations on 2D Airfoils.

The input of my Matlab program was a picture I took of the PDF I was sent.

The output of my Matlab program was the points, which could be imported to XFOIL.

Each airfoil did work in XFOIL.
