## Circle Localization

[Circle Localization Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/circle-localization)

Creates images of circles, creates labels, then finds the center of the circle and the diameter, as well as the certainty a circle is in the image.

## F1 Rear Wing

[F1 Rear Wing Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/f1-rear-wing)

I was sent a scan of an F1 wing by Craig Scarborough, and used Matlab to define the airfoil, then used XFOIL for CFD Analysis.

## Matrices

[Matrices Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/matrices)

Multiple notebooks doing matrix operations.

## Maze Solving Robot

[Maze Solving Robot Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/maze-solving-robot)

I made a robot that can solve mazes made by laying down a red blanket and laying down blue ribbons to create walls.

## MNIST From Scratch

[MNIST From Scratch Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/mnist-from-scratch)

MNIST Classification from scratch in multiple languages. Basically I only used Numpy for Python and Eigen for C++. I did it without ML libraries.

## Robotics Competition 2013

[Robotics Competition 2013 Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/robotics-competition-2013)

IEEE Southeast Con 2013 Open Hardware Competition. It was simulating a shipping container port. I was in charge of Computer Vision.

## SLAM

[SLAM Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/slam/cozmo)

I started doing SLAM with Anki Cozmo. This project is not complete.

## Spatial

[Spatial Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/spatial)

Various spatial kernels, such as edge detection and blurring etc.

## Stereo

[Stereo Folder](https://github.com/Kinvert/resume/tree/main/cv/stereo)

This was a tutorial someone wrote, which I was trying out
